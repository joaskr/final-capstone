              All three of us used to work for big corporations and we have
              dealt with countless cases of cyberattacks, which were possible to
              spot and prevent thanks to expensive software, skilled
              professionals within the company and proper training.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The idea of Mom-and-Pop-Safe was inspired by Kasia's parents, who
              run a small bookshop and during the COVID-19 pandemic moved their
              sales online. For their business, and countless similar companies,
              a data breach could mean bankruptcy - and without the means of
              multinational corporations, the owners have a hard time ensuring
              their business is protected on all fronts. While not all small
              business owners are lucky enough to have a
              security-specialist-daughter who can help protect their family
              business from cyberattacks, we believe everyone has the right to
              focus on providing goods and services to their customers without
              losing sleep over the online security of their business.
